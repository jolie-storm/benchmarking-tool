# JolieBenchmark

To run this benchmark a few things are requires from the user(you).

You must make a jolie program, containing an operaration "Run(undefined)(undefined)", which when run should run the method or program that needs to be benchmarked. If another program is being benchmarked, it should be running inside the same JVM as the jolie program itself. If your program depends on another program/communicated with one, that program should be opened seperately outside the benchmaker before it is run.

You may configure the config.json file to your liking, if nothing is inserted, default values are used.



metric_java_service.ol should be placed in jolie/packages

BenchmarkService.java should be placed in jolie/javaServices/coreJavaServices/src/main/java/joliex/benchmark

after which "mvn clean install" can be run from jolie/
